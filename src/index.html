      <p class="txt-main">Removal of earth from the land is called cutting while when earth is added to the slope, it is called filling. Sometimes the grading process may involve removal of excessive waste (landfills), soil and rocks, so designers should take into account while in the planning stage. <br> <br> Landscaping and other related professions can present a wide variety of health and safety hazards. This includes cuts and bruises, heat and cold related injuries, chemical related injuries, and muscle injuries due to bending or heavy lifting.</p>

      <p><span class="txt-main">Soil</span> <span class="txt-small">formation proceeds is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil. They are: parent material, climate, topography, organisms, and time. Scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate. Soil is the result of evolution from older geological materials under the action of biotic and abiotic processes.</span></p>

    <h1 class="head-main">Our Gardening Philosophy</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="txt-main">MATSUKO has two key tenets of great gardens: soil health <span class="num">1</span> and the nurturing of plant life <span class="num">2</span> which together create happy and healthy gardens. Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, and to container gardens grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings.</p>

      <p><span class="txt-main">Plants</span> <span class="txt-small">growth is also determined by environmental factors, such as temperature, available water, available light, carbon dioxide and available nutrients in the soil. Any change in the availability of these external conditions will be reflected in the plant's growth and the timing of its development. Fossils of seed ferns such as Glossopteris are widely distributed throughout several continents of the Southern Hemisphere.</span></p>

  </div>
  <!-- Questions and answers below -->
  <div class="faq-qa qa-one">
    <p class="txt-main">What services are part of the Full Garden Package?</p>
    <p class="txt-small">Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest form of gardening. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants and tends to be labor-intensive.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-qa qa-two">
    <p class="txt-main">Do you do patio design and installation?</p>
    <p class="txt-small">Patio options include concrete, stamped concrete, and aggregate concrete. Stamped concrete costs more, is known to be slippery, requires being resealed, and dyes typically fade in time. Aggregate concrete uses stones exposed giving its own style.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-qa qa-three">
    <p class="txt-main">Is MATSUKO covered under Garden Insurance Act 1923?</p>
    <p class="txt-small">Yes, insurance companies are rated by various agencies such as A.Â M. Best. The ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-qa qa-four">
    <p class="txt-main">Are there any upfront fees or deposits?</p>
    <p class="txt-small">No, like an activation fee, a setup fee is often charged by places that rent space or other things. In the case of self-storage businesses, this negates claims of "only one dollar for the first month" made by Public Storage and others.  Apartment complexes often charge fees for pets (mainly dogs and cats).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-qa qa-five">
    <p class="txt-main">Is sustainable drainage a part of design considerations?</p>
    <p class="txt-small">Slot drainage has proved the most breakthrough product of the last twenty years as a drainage option. As a channel drainage system it is designed to eliminate the need for further pipework systems to be installed in parallel to the drainage, reducing the environmental impact of production as well as improving water collection.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-qa qa-six">
    <p class="txt-main">What if I am not happy with the outcome of the work?</p>
    <p class="txt-small">Refunding occurs when an entity that has issued callable bonds calls those debt securities from the debt holders with the express purpose of reissuing new debt at a lower coupon rate. In essence, the issue of new, lower-interest debt allows the company to prematurely refund the older, higher-interest debt.</p>
